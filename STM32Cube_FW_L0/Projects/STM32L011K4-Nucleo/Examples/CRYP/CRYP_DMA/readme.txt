@par Example Description 

=================================================================================
WARNING :
To run this example, you must use an STM32L021xx device.
By default, the STM32L011K4-Nucleo boards (Nucleo32) are equiped with an STM32L011xx 
device which doesn't support the AES feature.
=================================================================================

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYP peripheral to 
encrypt and decrypt data using AES 128 Algorithm with ECB chaining mode in DMA mode.

DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the AES processor
input as well as to transfer data from AES processor output to memory.

64-byte buffers are ciphered and deciphered (4 AES blocks)
Ciphering/Deciphering with a 128-bit long key is used with data type set to 8-bit (byte swapping).

This example unrolls as follows: 
- AES Encryption (Plain Data --> Encrypted Data)
- AES Decryption with key derivation (Encrypted Data --> Decrypted Data)

LED3 is used to notify if the Encryption/Decryption failed

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC
HyperTerminal using the UART.



@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L021xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L011K4-Nucleo board with socket using STM32L021xx plugged-in  
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
@note: USUART2(COM1) is mapped on GPIO PA9(TX Arduino D1) and PA10(RX Arduino D0) 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
