@par Example Description 

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of HAL API on
how to program bank1 and bank2 of the STM32L0xx internal Flash memory mounted on STM32L073Z-EVAL
and possibly boot on one of them.

================================================================================
WARNING : This example is intended to be used only on old STM32L07xx/STM32L08xx 
device version (RevID previous to 0x2008) to demonstrate the proposed 
implementation which uses a SW workaround. The RevId can be retrieved via the 
function HAL_GetREVID().
================================================================================  

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) 
to run at 32 MHz. 
In this example, the user code is loaded in Flash memory (according to scatter file)
and DualBoot workaround run in RAM.

Below are the steps to run this example:
1- Choose the FLASH_DualBoot_Bank2_Boot project and generate its binary (ie: FLASH_DualBoot.bin)

2- You can use STM32 ST-LINK Utilities or any similar tool to initially reset the 
   BFB2 bit (disable the dual boot feature).
   
3- Load this binary at the bank2 of the flash(at the address 0x08018000) using 
   STM32 ST-LINK Utilities(www.st.com) or any similar tool. 
   
@note:
 - You can avoid step 1 by directly loading the binary file provided with the example
 - You have to configure your preferred toolchain in order to generate the binary
   file after compiling the project.  
   
4- using STM32 ST-LINK Utilities(www.st.com) or any similar tool
   pre-configure following values in registers:
 - To boot on Bank2: at the address DATA_VALUE_SELECT= 0x08080000 set DATA_BANK2_SELECTED= 0x00000037
   otherwise it will boot on Bank1 by default.
   
@note: at the address SYSCFG_MEMRMP_ADDRESS= 0x40010000 check that you have 0x00000000 (FLASH BOOT and Bank1 default)
@note: at the address 0x4002201C (FLASH_OPTR register) check that you have 0x807000AA (BTFB2=0 for RDP level0) 
       or 0x80700000 (BTFB2=0 for RDP level1) or 0x807000CC (BTFB2=0 for RDP level2).
@note: Just in case of Flash locked during pre-configuration, first run FLASH_Unlock() function.
  
5- Choose the FLASH_DualBoot_Bank1_Boot project and run it, this project will be loaded
   in the bank1 of the flash (default boot): at the address 0x08000000  
   
- If program in bank1 is selected, a message with a blue text back color will be 
  displayed on LCD and LED1 will remain toggling while LED2 is turn on.

- If program in bank2 is selected, a message with a red text back color will be 
  displayed on LCD and LED2 will remain toggling while LED1 is turn on.

- If error occurs LED3 is turn on.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L07xx and STM32L08xx devices. (Refer to the warning at the beginning
    of this readme.txt)
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L073Z-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
